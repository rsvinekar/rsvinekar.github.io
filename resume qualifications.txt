Application Scientist
Quantumzyme LLC, 
Bengaluru

09 2017 — 08 2020

Principal Investigator  (Project leader) for 4 projects. 
Utilised molecular dynamics and data science to predict mutations that improve the functionality of enzymes for industrial purposes.
Created benchmark presentation for BioCat conference, which contributed to bringing new customers to  Quantumzyme
Awarded Certificate of Appreciation “Above & Beyond”.
Achieved 95% increase in enzyme activity for one mutant in project QZ1803 – SmSDR. A provisional patent was filed for the same. Predicted mutant results led initiation of a new project with a new collaborator and funding using that mutant as base
Coupled Individual GPU workstations into a heterogeneous cluster with SLURM job scheduler, common NAS storage leading to easier management and utilisation of resources in  multiuser environment
Benchmarked and tweaked the cluster to obtain the best scheduling policies leading to a 40-80% speedup in GPU usage by enforcing single job per GPU and preventing parallel usage. Benchmarks showed that nVidia GPU could not multitask efficiently
